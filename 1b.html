<body> 
<p>I put my foot down on a luna moth
<br/>In the bathroom at your party
<br/>You screamed into my terrycloth
<br/>I said that I was sorry</p>
<p>You found me with a door locked
<br/>I only went upstairs to cry
<br/>I came over here to be alone
<br/>Not to kill your things that fly</p>
<p>I don't need anyone to hurt me
<br/>I can do that myself
<br/>I don't see why you would want me
<br/>If I could, I would be anybody else</p>
<p>Put a needle through a luna moth (through a luna moth)
<br/>The one I crushed and let you down
<br/>I left it on your doorstep
<br/>But I didn't stick around (but I didn't stick around)</p>
<p>To watch you smile at an ugly thing
<br/>To try to ease my guilt
<br/>Watch you lookin' at a broken wing
<br/>Like it could be rebuilt</p>
<p>I don't need anyone to hurt me
<br/>I can do that myself
<br/>I don't see why you would want me
<br/>If I could, I would be anybody else
<br/>If I could, I would be anybody еlse</p></body></html>
