            To mimic the deadline-driven environment of journalism and mass communication professions,
            this class employs strict deadlines. <br><b> Late assignments will not be accepted.</b><br>
        </p>

            If you have an emergency situation that prevents you from completing the assignments, you should contact
        the instructor as early as possible similar to how you would keep your boss aware of the situation.

            The purpose of these assignments is to get you familiar with using Brackets and typing codes. You should
        never copy and paste the code from the assignment sheet. Practicing the different attributes will help you with
        your projects where you will code from scratch.
